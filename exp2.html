                                        as a first generation Scrum Master in SimCorp. I also had the pleasure to collaborate with precious agile coaches 
                                        and thought leaders.

                                        Possessing both theoretical and practical knowledge and experience in Agile, as well having taken agile roles in practice is one of my superpowers as a senior leader.

                                        I should also mention that I give guest lectures in agile at the top Scandinavian universities, speak at agile conferences, as well as organize and participate in professionals events.

                                        Even in most sophisticated workplaces, one can encounter leaders that try to use Frederick Taylor's 
                                        mindset from more than 100 years ago, in today's world. Knowledge workers of today, can be lead by better approaches, 
                                        and coaching is one of the good methods that spans a different way of thinking and approaching to unlocking people's potential.
                                        I try to use coaching, when leading people while refraining from micromanagement, command&control, and carrot&stick motivation.

                                        DEI, and especially inclusion, is a focus area in my work life. 
                                        Most recently, I have been an active member of the DEI council in SimCorp representing the largest part of the organization: the product development.
                                        In this role, I had the chance to work closely with Elizabeth Benedict Christensen, PhD and SimCorp CEO Christian Kromann. 
                                        In addition, I have been actively contributing to both raising awareness, being an ally, as well using metrics to improve DEI.

                                        <p>As a Director of Engineering, I have proven track record in increasing the delivery efficiency of my organizations. One dimension that I have been immensely successful is the Cycle Time, which in my context is the number of days needed in order to implement a work item (e.g. a User Story or a Defect-fix) in average. In one organization, I reduced the cycle time from 16 days to 6 days, and in another organization I reduced the cycle time from 14 days to 5 days. Both cases happened gradually over a course of six months.

                                            I recruited more than 40 professionals in roles spanning Engineering Managers, Software Engineers, Test Analysts, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, DevOps Engineers, Data Engineers, Financial Analysts, Technical Writers, and Student Assistants. I recruited full time employees, part-time employees, and contractors. I recruited in Denmark, India, Poland, Sweden, and Ukraine. I tried to innovate and refine my recruitment approach, and I have presented about this in conferences.

                                        Majority of my academic work and scientific publications were on security. While I did not work in the industry on this topic 
                                        (with a remarkable exception of working for Poul Otto Schousboe for a short time when he was heading the security department of Danske Bank) I kept 
                                        my academic interest and I have been invited to security-related Master Thesis defenses and project works regularly.

                                        For computer science research, I have developed software tools in different programming languages such as Java, C, C++, C#, MatLab, Perl, Visual Basic. 
                                        As a professional software engineer, I mainly worked with C#, though I also worked with APL, PL/I, PL/B, and PowerShell. For personal use and out of 
                                        curiosity I also used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP; as well as ML. Although I haven't been professionally coding since I moved to leadership roles, I keep myself up to date and 
                                        acquired Azure, and Azure AI certifications.
